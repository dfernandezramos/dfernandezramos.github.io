      <description>When I first started in my current company I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used any version control system so when I started using Git it was a little tricky. Lucky me I had one of the best developers I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked with, Víctor Guzmán. I remember he said something like: &amp;ldquo;Ok, you can use a GUI for a bad Git usage or you can use the Terminal for learning real Git usage. I use Terminal so I won&amp;rsquo;t help you with if you don&amp;rsquo;t use it&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I got here. I know I did not do the best technical test my company gave to me because I know I left that two or three very important things I considere basic so my test was incomplete. The job interview was not bad at all but I feel that my interviewer has interviewed better developers than I. Maybe they were running out of time and they needed the first mid-decent developer they could find or maybe they had not enough money to hire that better developer that I was talking about.</description>
