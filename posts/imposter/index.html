        </div>

        <div class="post-content" id="post-content">
            <p>I don&rsquo;t know how I got here. I know I did not do the best technical test my company gave to me because I know I left that two or three very important things I considere basic so my test was incomplete. The job interview was not bad at all but I feel that my interviewer has interviewed better developers than I. Maybe they were running out of time and they needed the first mid-decent developer they could find or maybe they had not enough money to hire that better developer that I was talking about. I&rsquo;m an imposter.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m here almost five years later and that imposter syndrome is almost gone. Almost. Why do I say so? Well, I&rsquo;ve acquired a lot of experience because of excellent colleagues and I know I&rsquo;m not the same as before but more or less a year ago I decided to have a friendly talk with my boss to move from my workplace to look for a new adventure (and a better salary, why not say so?) to get in touch with a new team and get new knowledge. As I said I acquired a lot of knowledge in that four years working in my company and I was capable (and I am) of proving that I have no limits in my personal and professional growth, I have combined my full-time job with a university degree as developer engineer that I&rsquo;m finishing this year with very good grades and I am capable of doing complex tasks without fear. I honestly thought that I was going to be that &ldquo;better developer&rdquo; I was talking about at the beginning of this post at any job interview and in a way I was because like in my hiring process in my current company that &ldquo;better developer&rdquo; was not hired. I&rsquo;m not saying that the other candidates were worse, please do not misunderstand me.</p>
<p>So what happened? I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about it in this last year and the reason is obvious: I don&rsquo;t know how to explain what I do. I&rsquo;m not a theoretical but a practical person, so in the interview I limited myself to explain the huge amount of technologies I&rsquo;ve worked with and the different hard situations I had to face, but in front of questions like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did you do that thing that way?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are you using that technology instead of this one?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you tell us some alternatives of that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What benefits can you have doing that?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>My answers were the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well I think that&hellip; well.. you know what? To not be wrong I&rsquo;m going to say that I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You forgot something, David. You were not wrong but you also were not right.</p>
<p>So that is the reason I am still almost an imposter and I want to fix it by sharing my knowledge with calm and a relaxing cup of &ldquo;café con leche&rdquo; in my &ldquo;habitación&rdquo; (spanish joke) because I think that will help me retaining that theoretical part I need to improve as a developer. I hope we all enjoy this blog and it would be amazing if I can help anyone with it. Promise I will try to post something monthly!</p>
<p>See you all in the next post!</p>
