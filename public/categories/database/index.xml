      <description>&lt;p&gt;To SQL or to NoSQL? Is that the real question? Nah, the real war out there is to agree on how to pronounce it. Do you pronounce it “Ess-cue-ell” or maybe you pronounce it “sequel” like Bill Gates among others? If you want to know how I pronounce it… I use both just to bother people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jokes aside, let’s get on this post! Would you like to know the differences between these two database models? A lot of people are used to always using the same model because they use it at their work and since it is the one they know the most they use it on their personal projects too. It’s very common, so if you never went further on this and want a quick review then you are in the right place, my friend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
