      <description>First things first, I know I’ve been out for a couple of months without posting any article on my site. Sorry for that! I’ve been busy finishing up my computer science degree and I wanted to boost my final project by giving it my free time as much as possible. Thanks to that I have written down some Xamarin things to investigate and share them here, also. Now let’s get back to work!</description>

      <description>One of the most important things a .NET developer should know is what .NET is. It seems stupid but I know a lot of people that just starts coding and focusing in learning the .NET code they use. They can tell you why that .Count field is better than using the .Any () LINQ method to check for available values in your enumerator but they really don&amp;rsquo;t know (and some of them sadly don&amp;rsquo;t care) how their code is translated and optimized for a concrete processor in a concrete operating system.</description>
