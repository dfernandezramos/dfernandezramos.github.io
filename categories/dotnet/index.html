        <p class="card-text post-summery"><p>Let&rsquo;s continue with the .Net asynchronous programming series.</p>
<p>In the previous post we compared <code>Task</code> and <code>Thread</code> while explaining how the <code>Threadpool</code> and the <code>TaskScheduler</code> relate to tasks. Today I would like to expand more on two concepts so many others may have started with: <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>. What are they meant for? Are we achieving what we really want to achieve with them?</p>
<p>I usually see people thinking that awaiting a task leads to parallel processing. For me, that is one of the biggest misconceptions about asynchrony.</p></p>

You know you are doing things right because that is the way someone told you. Then when someone asks you something related to that topic you just find yourself explaining the &ldquo;how&rdquo; but not the &ldquo;why&rdquo;. If that is not your case, you are a lucky one. That is not mine, so I decided to go deep on basic things I use on my every-day work basis and leave them as blog posts.</p></p>

<p>Last summer I had to hire a new senior developer for my team and during the interview process, one profile got our attention in a particular way. He didn’t ask for extra money, goodies or benefits. He wanted me to evaluate the idea of migrating our application from GTK to Avalonia. He got me. After checking his amazing background with multiplatform front-end frameworks it was just matter of time to start working on this adventure.</p></p>

<p>Jokes aside, let’s get on this post! Would you like to know the differences between these two database models? A lot of people are used to always using the same model because they use it at their work and since it is the one they know the most they use it on their personal projects too. It’s very common, so if you never went further on this and want a quick review then you are in the right place, my friend.</p></p>

The previous post about <a href="https://www.theimpostersyndrome.dev/posts/windowsuglypackaging/">Windows packaging</a> was posted a couple of months ago and we learned how to create a simple Windows installer thanks to a Visual Studio extension. If you remember properly, there were some inconvenient like having two different installers (an MSI file for the app and an EXE file for the setup installer with the required extra components for our application). If you need a single EXE file, more modern-looking and cover the deficiencies of the previous packaging system, keep reading. I’ve got something for you!</p></p>

One of the features was not accepted and therefore its related user story was moved back from &ldquo;QA Review&rdquo; to &ldquo;On development&rdquo; again. I misunderstood my task.</p>
<p>What can we do here? Should we just tell the developer what was wrong and wait for him to change it ASAP or maybe should we try to guess what led him to do it that way the first time to see if we have a problem in our product development workflow? We think that the only way to improve is by learning from our own mistakes and we checked what was wrong: the user story was not well defined and I decided to do a freestyle with my imagination for the definition of done.</p></p>
