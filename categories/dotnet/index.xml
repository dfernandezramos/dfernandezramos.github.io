      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy new year 2026. May your life goals be achieved this year! Here is my little present for you: the third post about concurrency on .Net!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the previous post we compared &lt;code&gt;Concurrency&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Parallelism&lt;/code&gt; and also explained how &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; really work under the hood. Today we are going with a shorter (but not least important) one: &lt;code&gt;SynchronizationContext&lt;/code&gt;. What is it and why is it important in UI applications? Does it make my application faster?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s continue with the .Net asynchronous programming series.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the previous post we compared &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt; while explaining how the &lt;code&gt;Threadpool&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;TaskScheduler&lt;/code&gt; relate to tasks. Today I would like to expand more on two concepts so many others may have started with: &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;. What are they meant for? Are we achieving what we really want to achieve with them?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I usually see people thinking that awaiting a task leads to parallel processing. For me, that is one of the biggest misconceptions about asynchrony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel that sometimes you just know how things are done but never stopped to understand why? You know you are doing things right because that is the way someone told you. Then when someone asks you something related to that topic you just find yourself explaining the &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; but not the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo;. If that is not your case, you are a lucky one. That is not mine, so I decided to go deep on basic things I use on my every-day work basis and leave them as blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>.NET Framework vs .NET Core</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First things first, I know I’ve been out for a couple of months without posting any article on my site. Sorry for that! I’ve been busy finishing up my computer science degree and I wanted to boost my final project by giving it my free time as much as possible. Thanks to that I have written down some Xamarin things to investigate and share them here, also. Now let’s get back to work!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things a .NET developer should know is what .NET is. It seems stupid but I know a lot of people that just starts coding and focusing in learning the .NET code they use. They can tell you why that &lt;code&gt;.Count&lt;/code&gt; field is better than using the &lt;code&gt;.Any ()&lt;/code&gt; LINQ method to check for available values in your enumerator but they really don&amp;rsquo;t know (and some of them sadly don&amp;rsquo;t care) how their code is translated and optimized for a concrete processor in a concrete operating system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
