      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s continue with the .Net asynchronous programming series.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the previous post we compared &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt; while explaining how the &lt;code&gt;Threadpool&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;TaskScheduler&lt;/code&gt; relate to tasks. Today I would like to expand more on two concepts so many others may have started with: &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;. What are they meant for? Are we achieving what we really want to achieve with them?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I usually see people thinking that awaiting a task leads to parallel processing. For me, that is one of the biggest misconceptions about asynchrony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel that sometimes you just know how things are done but never stopped to understand why? You know you are doing things right because that is the way someone told you. Then when someone asks you something related to that topic you just find yourself explaining the &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; but not the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo;. If that is not your case, you are a lucky one. That is not mine, so I decided to go deep on basic things I use on my every-day work basis and leave them as blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
