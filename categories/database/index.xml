      <description>To SQL or to NoSQL? Is that the real question? Nah, the real war out there is to agree on how to pronounce it. Do you pronounce it “Ess-cue-ell” or maybe you pronounce it “sequel” like Bill Gates among others? If you want to know how I pronounce it… I use both just to bother people.
Jokes aside, let’s get on this post! Would you like to know the differences between these two database models?</description>
